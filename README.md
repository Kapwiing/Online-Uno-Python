# Online-Uno-Python
An online uno game in python because why not

# Modules Required :
pillow (PIL)
Tkinter

The client.py is for clients and server.py is for the server
You can find the ip that the server will bind to and the clients will connect in the first lines of the codes

The "Images" directory contains all the cards images files, they are required cleint-side for the game to correctly display itself.

If you get "PhotoImage" Errors, simply restart your IDE's kernel, same for "pyimage1 doesn't exist"
